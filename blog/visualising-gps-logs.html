<h2>
 Introduction
</h2>
<p>
 I've been collecting GPS data using my phone for about a year and a half now (partially out of curiosity and partially so I could have a data-set of my own to play around with). Currently my processing is pretty simple and just pointed at creating a few pretty
 <a href="https://adventuresinmapping.com/2016/10/17/firefly-cartography">
  firefly-style maps
 </a>
 . I've had to sit on this project for a little while because the most interesting outputs all plainly identify my house or a friend's house, but having moved house recently has freed that up significantly.
</p>
<h2>
 Collecting Data
</h2>
<p>
 My point-collection setup went through a few iterations before I settled on a final version. The first (stupid) method was manually putting down points in QField on my phone (which I was experimenting with at the time). I stopped doing this pretty quickly as it was dull, didn't collect much in the way of metadata and was pretty unsafe (I almost walked into a few roads while looking at my phone).
</p>
<p>
 The next (and current) solution is to use a purpose-built app to record the data directly into a csv without manual interference.
 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&amp;hl=en_GB">
  The app
 </a>
 also records other data at the same time (most notably accuracy) that I wouldn't otherwise be able to get at. The only real downside is a hit to my battery of about 10%.
</p>
<p>
 I've opted for a somewhat over-the-top approach to recording points, with the app recording one every 2 seconds while I'm moving. Over the past year and a bit this has generated quite a large number of points - which has made visualisation pretty interesting at the other end.
</p>
<h2>
 Storing the Data
</h2>
<p>
 I opted to do most of my processing in-database as the project was likely to be fairly data-intensive and access to indexes etc while running seemed like a good idea due to the relatively large quantity of data I'm generating.
</p>
<p>
 At first, I stored the data in a simple SpatiaLite database that also joined consecutive points into lines if they passed an accuracy / timing threshold, but that quickly got clogged up with the volume of data I was trying to throw around through it on a regular basis. I switched to PostGIS, with an R script on the front end to throw the CSVs in automatically using ogr2ogr. Once the data was in the database, trigger functions handled the rest.
</p>
<p>
 It taken a little while to tune the triggers so that they run in a reasonable time. I tried not to assume that the data was coming in the exact right order of files / rows, so I couldn't just look at the previous point to see if a line needed to be created so I had to pull out all of the point within a particular duration - a functional index turned out to be a good method here. For example:
</p>
<div class="codehilite">
 <pre><span></span><code><span class="k">CREATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">INDEX</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">gps_point_time_plus_20_idx</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">ON</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">gps_data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">gps_point</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">USING</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">btree</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="ss">"time"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'00:00:20'</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nb">interval</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">TABLESPACE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">pg_default</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
 This resulted in a pipeline where I could just offload csv files into a folder whenever it was convenient, run the R script and have all my data run through my processing automatically.
</p>
<h2>
 Visualising the Output
</h2>
<p>
 Visualisation of this data has been quite a fun challenge, as it's got harder as time went on. When I only had a few points and lines I could have bold arrows on the lines and other decoration on my geometries. As the points built up things started to get more and more cluttered. A few of the problems I've noticed are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Even recording a point every few seconds doesn't produce points at a high enough density to form an obvious route (especially when I started playing around with transparency).
  <ul>
   <li>
    This is helped by joining consecutive points into lines as a background layer. The lines didn't need that high a contrast to help reduce ambiguity.
   </li>
   <li>
    The inverse is true too - in areas where I regularly walk the density of points is so high that it's impossible to make out anything clearly.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  The phone GPS I'm using isn't hyper-accurate and just giving all points the same visual weight created some weird paths.
  <ul>
   <li>
    My solution here was to get QGIS to give each point a transparency and size based on its accuracy level (so lower accuracy points were larger pale circles). Because both the accuracy measurement and coordinate system I'm using are in metres I could get QGIS to give the points a size equal to their accuracy envelope.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  For overlaying multiple points with transparency I played around with blend-modes in QGIS, eventually going for addition-style blending on a black background.
  <ul>
   <li>
    An
    <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2017/02/carto-tips-using-blend-modes-opacity-levels/">
     Ordinance Survey blog post
    </a>
    covers these better than I can.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 So my end result was to have faint lines in the background, overlaid by variable-transparency points. I feel like there's a bit more work to do here, but this is a decent enough point to park things.
</p>
<p>
 Below I've got a quick example of the difference that even very faint lines make:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 This does end up making the output look quite a bit more busy, particularly in areas I've been through multiple times (as it adds up to a lighter background). Personally I prefer having the lines in for less-travelled areas.
</p>
<h2>
 More Detail on the Database
</h2>
<p>
 As I've already mentioned, I'd put together a small SpatiaLite database to store my first results - but as the data set passed several months SQLite started to act as a bottleneck on a few operations (or at least my understanding of how indexes in SQLite work). I ended up switching to PostGIS, which also seems to have improved performance (with the full code being
 <a href="https://github.com/JosephMcGrath/Misc-scripts/tree/master/PostGreSQL/Schema_GPS_Data">
  here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 The problem in question was joining up consecutive points with linestrings. In SpatiaLite I'd kind-of hacked things around by assuming the previous point entered into the database was the one to compare against. While that's not a
 <em>
  bad
 </em>
 assumption, it means data has to be fed into the database in a very particular way. Instead I applied the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  When a new GPS point is entered into the database, generate a line between it and most recent the point meeting the following criteria:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The point is at most 20 seconds before the current point.
   </li>
   <li>
    The accuracy measurement of both points is less than 25 metres.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The tricky part for my novice understanding of PostgreSQL was returning 'points within 20 seconds' from a variable point in time while keeping things quick. Eventually I came up with this index which does the job (but is limited to 20 second intervals):
</p>
<div class="codehilite">
 <pre><span></span><code><span class="k">CREATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">INDEX</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">gps_point_time_plus_20_idx</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">ON</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">gps_data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">gps_point</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">USING</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">btree</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">TABLESPACE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">pg_default</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
 Which defines a
 <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/indexes-expressional.html">
  functional index
 </a>
 on the result of adding 20 seconds to the point's timestamp. So far this has been scalling reasonably well as a long-term solution one and a half million points in.
