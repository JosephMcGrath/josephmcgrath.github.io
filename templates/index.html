  <h1>Joe McGrath</h1>
  <p>This is my personal page, it's likely to end up a bit of a mishmash of blogs, tutorials and annotated snippets of code.</p>
  <p>I'm a GIS specialist, working in the UK water industry. My education's in in geology and geomorphology but since graduating I've gone into hydraulic modelling.</p>

  <h2>Blogs</h2>
  <p>Sometimes I write blogs, they're a mix of speculation, small projects I've done, walkthroughs and anything else that comes to mind.</p>
